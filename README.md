##Band Central

Author: Garrett Olson

Band Central is a Sinatra app that tracks bands and the venues they've played at.

#Setup

Start by running the following Rake commands to set up the database:

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
```

Boot up a local Sinatra server (localhost:4567) and navigate to the root directory ('/'). Let the intuitive UI guide you.
